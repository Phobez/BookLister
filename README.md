# BookLister
An Android app which lists information about 10 books you search for using data from Google Books.

## About

This app was made for the `Book Listing app` lesson in a free Udacity course provided by Google [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-networking--ud843).

## Why

I made this as part of my training to become an Android engineer at work.
